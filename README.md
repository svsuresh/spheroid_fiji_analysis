use macros with versions for better analysis. Macros are tested on FIJI (ImageJ v2). 

- multiple_images.ijm - Macro for identifying spheroids from multiple images
- multiple_images_v14.ijm.java - Macro for identifying spheroids from multiple images (better version)
- single_image.ijm - Macro for identiying spheroid from single image
- single_image_manual.txt - Manual identifcation of spheroid
- ingle_image_v2.ijm.java - Macro for identifying spheroid from single image

All macros need to be run from run macro option available within fiji app. In addition, change the input and output directory in the macro.
