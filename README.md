use macros with versions for better analysis. Macros are tested on FIJI (ImageJ v2). 

- multiple_images.ijm - Macro for identifying spheroids from multiple images
- multiple_images_v14.ijm - Macro for identifying spheroids from multiple images (better version)
- single_image.ijm - Macro for identiying spheroid from single image
- single_image_manual.txt - Manual identifcation of spheroid
- single_image_v2.ijm - Macro for identifying spheroid from single image
- spheroid.jpg - Example spheroid image to test single image macro and manual identification

All macros need to be run from run macro option available within fiji app. In addition, change the input and output directory in the macro. Macro measures spheroid after identification of largest particle in the image. Make sure spheroid images are of good quality as provided in example image.
